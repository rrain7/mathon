Learn math and show it in Python.

---

today I read a [blog](https://catcoding.me/p/redis-antriez), and I think I should not limit what I only do, but keep the love for the world.

I have always been passionate about math, not just the problem solving skills I learned during school, but the desire to understand what math really means, so this repository will record some of my math notes.

Perhaps, in conclusion, this repository is just a demonstration of some problem solving techniques, but I will try to illustrate as much as possible what it means in the real world and show some code to help understand it when appropriate.

Ok, let's go.
